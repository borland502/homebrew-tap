# Homebrew Tap

This repository contains my [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) formulae for personal use.

## How Do I Install These Formulae?

`brew install joeploijens/tap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap joeploijens/tap` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joeploijens/homebrew-tap/master/Formula/<formula>.rb
```

If the formula conflicts with one from Homebrew/homebrew-core or another tap, you
can `brew install joeploijens/tap/<formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/homebrew/README.md#readme).
